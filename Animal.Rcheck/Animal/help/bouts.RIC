_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Merges single visits from roughage intake log file if the time
     difference between successive visits is less than specified time
     difference i.e merges multiple rows in the log file that are
     considered to be a single feeding bout to a single row.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     bouts.RIC(data, bout.diff = 5)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: A data.frame read in with read.RIC, with clean=T option

bout.diff: The maximum time difference (in minutes) between visits in a
          single bout

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A data.frame with the values merged for individual bouts. All
     other objects are self.explanatory, but there are two that need
     further clarification   

bout.duration: This is the duration in minutes of the merged bout i.e.
          begin-end for the bout.

intake.duration: This is the time in minutes that the cow has kept her
          head in the feeding trough during the bout. You may want to
          use this for calculating feeding speed (kg/min)

_N_o_t_e:

     The function is currently only implemented for merging feeding
     time and intake, thus protein, ash etc. are dropped from the
     resulting datafrane. The variables in the code are finnish and
     thus maybe difficult to follow. An english translation will
     (possibly) appear in the future.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     data(RIC)
     cleaned.data <- clean.RIC(RIC)
     bouts <- bouts.RIC(cleaned.data)
     #With 8 minutes bout difference
     bouts <- bouts.RIC(cleaned.data,bout.diff=8)
