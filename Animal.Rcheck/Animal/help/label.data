_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function labels measurement data according to behavioral
     observations. The format of behavioral observations follows CowLog
     convention (See details).

_U_s_a_g_e:

     label.data(data, observation, db = 5, de = 5, min.length = 20)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: A data.frame holding the measurement data, one of the
          elements needs to be named time and hold the time stamp for
          each row.

observation: A data.frame with behavioral observations, one of the
          elements needs to be named time and hold the time stamps for
          the behaviors and another named behavior and hold the labels
          for respective behaviors. See details.

      db: Specifies the delay in seconds from the observation to the
          start of labeling, this is sometimes useful if the data is
          used for model building and we want to eliminate the temporal
          inaccury due to behavioral observations. Defaults to 5

      de: Similarly to db, specifies the (negative) delay in seconds
          from the end of observation. Defaults to 5

min.length: descibes the minimum length of the labeled data vector.
          Again sometimes we want to have long enough data vectors for
          model building and leave out too short bits. This is the
          length after substracting db and de. Defaults to 20

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The time stamp in behavior and data need to be in the same format
     i.e. POSIXt or seconds from the start in numeric format. The
     POSIXt is naturally more convinient since then the behavioral
     observation and the measurement need not to begin from the same
     time point. The data.frame observation need to have at least two
     elements: time and behavior (any additional elements are ignored).
     The time specifies the start of the corresponding behavior and the
     start time of the next behavior is used as the end of the previous
     one. The format is adopted from CowLog behavioral coding software
     (http://www.mm.helsinki.fi/~mpastell/CowLog).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The original data with two additional elements: 'label' which
     contains the labels for each row in the data and 'freq' which
     tells the number of the label counting from the beginning.
