_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function returns the part of day from time stamps. The day
     can be split into parts of different length with a chosen start
     time for the splits.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     partOfDay(time, nsplit = 4, start = 1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    time: Timestamp vector in POSIXct format

  nsplit: Number of splits.

   start: Start time of the split in hours (1-24)

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     It is often useful to observe the amount of behaviors during
     different part of day e.g. if we want to find out how different
     behaviours are distributed over the entire day. This function
     returns the part of day from time stamps. The function returns
     only even hours, if nsplit provides intervals with decimal hours
     they will be rounded to nearest integer.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A factor with the part of day for input timestamps with hour
     intervals as labels-
